              CodeLearnn is a career discovery and learning pathway platform
              built for a world where skills evolve faster than traditional
              education systems.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Instead of creating new courses, CodeLearnn structures the vast
              amount of free learning content already available across the
              internet and YouTube into clear, goal-oriented learning paths
              aligned with real careers. The platform helps users explore career
              options, understand required skills, follow structured learning
              journeys, practice through projects, track progress, and build a
              living profile that reflects real proof-of-work rather than just
              certificates.
